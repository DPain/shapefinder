# Project 2: Shapefinder
Uses OpenCV to detect the shapes: rectangle, square, circle.

### Dependencies
* OpenCV 3.4.3

### My workspace
I worked on the project using Visual Studio 2017. Windows 10 64 bit.

### Build from source
I guess you could run the command `g++ -o shapefinder shapefinder.cpp` to build the binary on a Linux environment, but I haven't tested it. You can also build the binary on Visual Studio 2017 in a Windows environment or just run the binary I compiled on a 64 bit Windows environment.

The rsc folder that contains the images must be in the same directory where the shapefinder executable is located.
